# Future Considerations

Items flagged during development as worth revisiting when the time is right.

---

## Local Secret Management

Currently, local Bazel remote cache credentials are stored in `.bazelrc.user` (gitignored). This is
acceptable for a single-user machine but not rigorous. Other secrets are stored in //secrets, which
is gitignored.

A proper solution would retrieve secrets from a secrets manager (e.g. macOS Keychain, 1Password CLI)
rather than storing them in a file on disk.

## Renovate Trigger Frequency

Renovate appears to trigger on every branch push rather than only on changes to main. This is more
frequent than expected and worth investigating — it may be a configuration issue or a default
behaviour that can be tightened.

## Gazelle Python Support

Gazelle has a Python plugin bundled with `rules_python` that can auto-generate `py_library`,
`py_binary`, and `py_test` targets — equivalent to what it does for Go. It was not configured
because the Python footprint is currently small.

This is actively tracked: the `python-scale-check` CI job and pre-commit hook will fail when the
py\_\* target count exceeds the configured threshold, at which point this item should be actioned.

## Introducing cgo

The build infrastructure assumes **pure Go** (no cgo). The rationale is build simplicity and
hermeticity: pure-Go means no LLVM toolchain, no sysroots, no Apple SDK handling, and Linux outputs
are statically linked. `rules_go` runs in pure mode via `--@rules_go//go/config:pure` in `.bazelrc`.

The assumption is enforced by [`meta/scripts/check_no_cgo.py`](../meta/scripts/check_no_cgo.py),
which runs as the `no-cgo-check` CI job. It rejects:
- Any `.go` file in this repo containing `import "C"`.
- Any transitive Go dependency that compiles C, C++, cgo, SWIG, or ships pre-built
  `.syso` objects (detected via `go list -deps` with `CGO_ENABLED=1`).

Python is **not** held to an analogous purity policy — see [Python Purity Is Not
Enforced](#python-purity-is-not-enforced) below for that side of the story.

### Why The Current Choice Was Made

We audited cgo usage at the time of this decision and found **zero** uses across the
repo's source and full transitive dep graph (1 module, 198 transitive packages). Every
direct Go dep (vbauerster/mpb, VividCortex/ewma, acarl005/stripansi, clipperhouse/uax29,
mattn/go-runewidth, golang.org/x/sys) is pure-Go. The expected near-term workload
(network-management tooling) does not have an obvious cgo trigger.

Setting up the LLVM + sysroot infrastructure for a hypothetical future need was rejected
as premature complexity. The policy + enforcement check make the assumption explicit
rather than implicit, so a future change is a deliberate decision rather than a quiet
drift.

## Python Purity Is Not Enforced

Unlike Go, Python is **not** held to a purity policy. Impure Python deps (wheels with
C extensions — `numpy`, `cryptography`, `pydantic`'s rust core, etc.) are allowed. The
trade-off is that the "any host → any target" property the Go side enjoys does **not**
extend to Python: Python targets are built and tested on a host that matches the target
platform, and CI's per-platform runners cover the supported set.

### Why The Policies Diverge

For Go, purity is cheap to maintain — `--@rules_go//go/config:pure` plus the cgo check is
a few lines of config and a small script, and the Go toolchain already ships every
`GOOS`/`GOARCH` pair. We lose nothing by enforcing it.

For Python the same property is much more expensive to maintain, and the benefit is
smaller:

- **Auto-detection is weak.** Python has no `import "C"` marker. Source-level scans
  (`import ctypes`, `.pyx`, `Extension(...)`) catch the blatant cases but miss the
  dominant failure mode: an innocent-looking `import numpy` whose transitive deps ship
  C. The clean dependency-level check — "every resolved wheel ends in
  `-py3-none-any.whl`" — needs a `rules_python` pip lock file we don't have, and only
  catches issues *after* the lock is generated.
- **The Python ecosystem expects native wheels.** Refusing them closes the door on
  most numerics, crypto, and serialization libraries. The cost of staying pure
  compounds with every dep added.
- **CI matrix coverage is a workable substitute.** If a Python target works on a Linux
  runner and a Mac runner, it works on the platforms we ship to. We don't need
  "build darwin from a Linux host" to work in the abstract; we need "darwin works on
  Macs" to work in practice.
